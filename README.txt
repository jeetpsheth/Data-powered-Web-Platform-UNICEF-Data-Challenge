# Estimating-Poverty-Across-Borders



## Description

-------------

In this project we predict the HDI (Human Development Index) using social media data, immigration data, and infrastructure data. The deliverable includes a Web App, backend service API, scripts to fetch OSM (OpenStreetMap) data, and the analysis results.

## Folder Description

-------------


├── data        # Training dataset, includes mobility, countries, and HDI prediction

├── diagram     # Analysis results and cross validation

├── FrontEnd    # All FrontEnd Web App Code

├── models    	# Random Forest Training models

├── OSMscripts  # Scripts to fetch infrastructure data from OSM

├── python-api  # API to host server for backend services and regressor model to analyze results

## Installation & Execution

-------------

If you want to run the webapp in your local machine, please first install *npm* into your computer.
If you are using windows, you can try out Anaconda Prompts. 
After the installation, please navigate to *FrontEnd* folder and run the following two commands.

```
npm install
npm run 
```

Then you should be able to reach `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

#Backend
The data API can be hosted locally using the commands in *python-api* folder:
```
source vv/bin/activate
python api.py
```
The above commands are only required if any changes need to be made to the backend. However, the API is hosted for data consumption on Heroku at https://shrouded-lake-82256.herokuapp.com/get_data

## Trouble Shooting
If you encounter some errors like
```
/node-sass/vendor no such file or directory in node-sass
```
please run 
```
npm rebuild node-sass
``` 

to fix the problem when you deploy web app on AWS EC2.
